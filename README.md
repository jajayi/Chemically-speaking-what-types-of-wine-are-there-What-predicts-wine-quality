# Chemically-speaking-what-types-of-wine-are-there-What-predicts-wine-quality
In this study I use a clustering algorithm and regression analysis in python to analyse wine.

Based on the information we have availble in the data sets, I want to answer the following questions
- What different types of wine are there from a chemical standpoint?
- What attributes are important in wine quality?

Why would this be useful? By better understanding products, what causes variation in taste (quality) and where the similarities lie (type) in terms of chemical composition, an organisation is better equipped to:
- Market their products better
- Understand their customer segments and what they value in their wine
- Differentiate their products from competitors
- Improve and refine their products
